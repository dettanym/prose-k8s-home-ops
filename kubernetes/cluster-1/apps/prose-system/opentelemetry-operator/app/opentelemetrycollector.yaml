    #Configures the OpenTelemetry Operator.
    # Check the main docs here: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/
    # They link to configuration for each of the receivers, processors, exporters keys.
    # Also check subfolders under the Opentelemetry-collector-contrib repo: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/
    # for real-life configurations for each of them.
    # These 3 keys only configure these components; the 'service' key enables them.
